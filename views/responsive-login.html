            <h3 class="font-bold">One place. One password. All your programs.</h3>
            <p>
                The average loyalty member belongs to 13 different programs* — and that means 13 sets of usernames and passwords to remember, and logging in to 13 different websites to keep tabs on your earnings. The Points Loyalty Wallet makes loyalty management easy, showing you all of your balances at a glance, with a single login.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-bold">Move points and miles between your programs.</h3>
            <p>

                Ready to maximize your loyalty potential? Exchange allows you to convert points or miles from one of your loyalty programs to another. Take a look around your loyalty wallet — you might be a quick swap or two away from your next vacation.
            </p>
             <h3  class="font-bold">More options and offers to reward yourself — and others.</h3>
            <p>
                What’s more rewarding than treating yourself to a just-because gift? Use the points and miles you’ve collected for shopping, having new experiences, dining, etc and really discover your travel’s destination.
